Patching a library available on the DUB registry
================================================

How to patch a [DUB](http://code.dlang.org/) library with minimal hassle for users?

  1. Commit your hopefully working fix.
  2. Test it. `dub add-local` or `dub test` can help to do it.
  3. Make a git tag. **Please try to respect** [SemVer](http://semver.org/) with respect to breaking changes, else you could break an unknown number of already released software. Also don't name your tag `1.0.0` instead of `v1.0.0`, else the registry won't take it. Likewise avoid leading zeroes like `v2.3.04`.
  4. Push the changes online. I would advise `git push` then `git push --tags` but to be honest I don't really know why it's better in this order. At this point the fix is online. This is not finished yet!
  5. Login on [http://code.dlang.org](http://code.dlang.org) and click on `Trigger manual update` button. This will acknowledge the new version and allow downstream to update to the new tag as soon as possible. **Do not skip this step if you want a timely fix.** If you don't do the manual update, the new tag will be acknowledged by the registry in less than 30 minutes. 
  6. If downstream doesn't actually download the latest tag, consider using `dub clean-caches` to update the list of available packages.
  7. Your users are now delighted. Enjoy the endorphin rush.
