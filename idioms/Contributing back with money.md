Contributing back with money
============================

While the D phenomenon relies primarily on benevolent effort, a bit of money can go a long way towards enhancing documentation, supporting libraries, compilers and IDEs.

**If your company depends on a healthy D ecosystem**, your donations will have a noticeable impact in spreading D to the programming world, while hedging against related technology risks.


## The D Foundation

The [D Language Foundation](https://dlang.org/foundation/donate.html) is a 501(c) non-profit public charity devoted to advancing open source technology related to the D programming language.

A one-stop shop for pushing the interests of the D world at large.

You can contribute for free through Amazon Smile! [https://forum.dlang.org/thread/pikn41$u9q$1@digitalmars.com](https://forum.dlang.org/thread/pikn41$u9q$1@digitalmars.com)


## LDC

[The LDC project](https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc) is pivotal to many D companies that profit from top performance.
If you are one of them, consider giving back to this critical piece of infrastructure...


## GDC

[The GDC project](https://gdcproject.org/) is also pivotal to high-performance D. As part of GCC, GDC is the D compiler with the most platform reach, so funding GDC is a great technology hedge.
